-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/levelup/Data.lua — the curated FALLBACK, and nothing more.
--
-- Harvest.lua learns spells, battlegrounds, dungeons, raids and talent-point steps from the live
-- server. What is left here is the short list of unlocks the 3.3.5a client exposes no API for at
-- all: you cannot ask it at what level glyph slots open. Those are Blizzlike constants, used only
-- until (and unless) the harvest observes something better, and Unlocks.lua always prefers observed
-- data over anything in this file.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT HERE — profession specializations. NewEra fires those at "the typical character
-- level when the spec becomes practical", which is a guess about a SKILL gate dressed up as a level
-- gate, and a private server that moves the skill requirement makes it simply wrong. Specialization
-- trainers are trainers, so where a server does gate them on level, Harvest.lua picks them up with
-- the server's own number. Inventing a level we cannot observe is the thing this rebuild exists to
-- stop doing.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT HERE — the class spell tables. That is the whole point; see Harvest.lua's header.
