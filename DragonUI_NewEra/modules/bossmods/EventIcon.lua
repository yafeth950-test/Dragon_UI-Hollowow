-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/bossmods/EventIcon.lua — retail's EncounterTimelineEventIconTemplate
-- (EncounterTimelineTemplates.xml:51-168), the shared event-icon assembly the rail's tracks build.
--
-- Downport of ReferenceAddons/NewEra/Alerts/BossMods/EventIcon.lua. Atlas sizes, anchors, draw
-- sublevels and animation values all still match retail source.
--
-- Which STATES actually fire: retail drives deadly/paused/queued off C_EncounterTimeline, which
-- does not exist here. Two of the three are reachable anyway — `paused` from DBM's own pause verb
-- (DBM_TimerPause) and `queued` from the rail's own queued track — so only `deadly` is built and
-- never shown. It costs two textures and keeps the assembly a faithful copy.
--
-- DOWNPORT, in summary:
--   * Both MaskTextures are gone. Frame:CreateMaskTexture returns nil on 3.3.5a (!!!ClassicAPI
--     declares it Private.Void), so the icon is rounded by a texcoord trim under the CDM overlay
--     ring instead. The highlight SWIRL, which retail clips with the second mask, is not ported at
--     all — unmasked it is a filled disc three times the icon's width. See the block on it below,
--     and PORT_PLAN.md §C.3 / §C.5e.
--   * Animation:SetTarget does not exist here, so the one HighlightAnimation that drove two
--     textures becomes one group per texture, played together by PlayHighlight.
--   * SetShown is banned (CONTRACTS §0) → BM.SetShown.

  -- Retail's EncounterTimelineEventIconTemplate puts `combattimeline-fx-highlight-fx` here, a

  -- combattimeline-fx-highlight-mask. There is no clip available on 3.3.5a, and an earlier build
  -- shipped it unmasked on the guess that it would read as a soft bloom slightly wider than the
  -- ring. It does not. Sampling the sheet directly settles it:
  --
  --     combattimeline-fx-highlight     86x86   centre alpha  38, ring alpha 149  -> a RING
  --     combattimeline-fx-highlight-fx  107x107 centre alpha 211, ring alpha 155  -> a FILLED DISC
  --
  -- A solid 211-alpha disc three times the width of a 35px icon, drawn additively over the spell
  -- art and its neighbours on the rail. That is what the owner saw. modules/cooldownviewer/Alerts.lua
  -- reached the identical conclusion about retail's PandemicFX quads and declined them for the same
  -- reason ("Worse than no FX"); this follows that precedent rather than re-litigating it.
  --
  -- What remains is the GLOW RING, which the sample above confirms is genuinely hollow and so needs
  -- no clip at all. It is the part that carries the signal — this ability is imminent — and it is
  -- what retail's highlight reads as from a distance. The rotation went with the swirl: there is
  -- nothing left for it to spin.
  --
  -- The ring group ENDS HIDDEN, set explicitly. A 1 → 0 fade does not leave a region at 0 on this
  -- client any more than a 0 → 1 fade leaves it at 1 (PORT_PLAN §C.5c), and a highlight that never
  -- switches off is a permanent glow on a stale icon.
