-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/bossmods/DBMAdapter.lua — the DBM backend for the boss-timer renderers.
--
-- Downport of ReferenceAddons/NewEra/Alerts/BossMods/DBMAdapter.lua. It feeds the same internal bus
-- (BM.Bus*) the source did; Register.lua calls BM.RegisterWithDBM() at boot, gated on DBM being
-- installed at all.
--
-- ============================ CONTRACT (read off the INSTALLED DBM) ==========================
--
-- The source was written against DBM master (a 2026 retail/Classic core). This client runs the
-- WotLK 3.3.5a fork (AddOns/DBM-Core + AddOns/DBM-StatusBarTimers), which is compatible but
-- NARROWER, and differs in two ways that matter. Everything below was verified in that source,
-- not assumed from the upstream contract:
--
--   Mechanics — unchanged. DBM:RegisterCallback(event, fn) (DBM-Core.lua:1564), invoked
--   pcall(fn, event, ...) (:1540): the event name arrives FIRST, ahead of the payload.
--
--   DBM_TimerStart (DBM-Core.lua:10049)
--       id, msg, timer, icon, timerType, spellId, colorId, modId, keep, fade, name, guid
--     * The DBT bar is created FIRST, at :10007, and the callback only fires if that succeeded
--       (`if not bar then return false, "error" end`, :10008-10010). So the bar always exists by
--       the time we are told about the timer — which matters twice over: suppression can act
--       synchronously, and if DBT ever refuses to make a bar we hear nothing at all. See the
--       reaper below, which is what keeps DBT able to make one.
--     * DBM_TimerBegin — the modern rename the source registered FIRST — is never fired by this
--       fork. Registering both is still correct and free: one of them simply never arrives, and a
--       server running a newer core would send that one instead. Same id ⇒ the bus dedupes.
--     * The arg list STOPS at `guid`. timerCount / isPriority / fullType / hasVariance /
--       variancePeakTimer / isBarEnabled do not exist here, so they arrive nil — which is why both
--       guards below are written to degrade rather than assume: `isBarEnabled == false` is never
--       true (nothing is wrongly dropped) and `hasVariance` is never set (no bar is drawn as
--       approximate). Both stay, so a newer core is honoured the moment one appears.
--     * id is DBM's real timer id (unique per instance, target args appended) — our bus key.
--     * icon is a texture path or fileID; msg is pre-localized display text.
--   DBM_TimerStop (id[, guid]) · DBM_TimerPause (id) · DBM_TimerResume (id)
--   DBM_TimerUpdate (id, elapsed, totalTime) — re-baseline remaining/max.
--   DBM_Announce (message, icon, type, spellId, modId, isSpecial) — DBM-Core.lua:8183
--     (isSpecial=false, a regular announce) and :9259 (isSpecial=true, a special warning).
--   DBM_Wipe (mod) — DBM-Core.lua:5179. Belt-cancel any bars DBM did not stop itself.
--   DBM_Kill (mod) — DBM-Core.lua:5238. See the note on onKill: this addon has no boss banner.
--
-- ============================ SUPPRESSION (no double-draw) ===================================
--
-- DBM's own DontShow*/HideDBM* options CANNOT be used for this: every one of them early-returns
-- BEFORE the callback fires, which would starve our renderer of the very events it draws. So
-- suppress VISUALLY, session-only, with no SavedVariable writes — nothing to stash or restore.
--
-- DOWNPORT — the source's mechanism does not work on this fork, in two independent ways:
--   1. It reaches the bar anchor through `DBM.Bars`, which does not exist here. The bar library is
--      the GLOBAL `DBT` (DBM-StatusBarTimers/DBT.lua:43), with GetBarIterator at :605. Ported
--      verbatim, findDBTAnchor would return nil forever and every bar would be drawn twice.
--   2. It reaches the anchor through one live bar. Both anchors are unnamed locals created at
--      DBT.lua:179, so a bar IS the only handle — but every bar is created on smallBarsAnchor
--      (DBT.lua:249) and is never reparented; huge bars only re-POINT to the large anchor
--      (:663, :1120). Hiding the small anchor therefore hides every bar there is, and the
--      largeBarsAnchor this collects will in practice never have a child. It is collected anyway:
--      it costs one table entry, and a fork that did reparent would otherwise leak bars on screen.
-- The warning hosts DBMWarning (DBM-Core.lua:7812) and DBMSpecialWarning (:8849) do exist under
-- those exact global names, so those suppress exactly as the source wrote them.
--
-- Sounds and voice stay DBM's, deliberately: we replace what is DRAWN, not what is heard.

local suppressed = {}   -- frame → "hide" | "alpha", so restoring undoes the right thing

-- TWO INSTRUMENTS, and which one is right depends on what DBM does to the frame afterwards.
--
--   HIDE, for the bar anchors. A hidden parent hides its children, unambiguously, on every client —
--     where a parent's ALPHA reaching its child frames is exactly the thing this client is unreliable
--     about (PORT_PLAN §C.5d). DBT shows its two anchors once at load (DBT.lua:184, :189) and never
--     again, so hiding them sticks, and a bar created later is born a child of an already-hidden
--     anchor and is invisible from its first frame with no polling.
--   HIDE + AN OnShow HOOK, for the warning hosts. Alpha was tried there first, on the reasoning that
--     DBM re-Shows them on every announce so hiding would flicker. It does not work: DBM drives
--     `font:SetAlpha(1)` on a 0.05s ticker (DBM-Core.lua:8036, :8878) and re-Shows the host, so an
--     alpha we set on the parent is either composed away or simply outrun — and DBM's warning ICONS
--     are inline |T..|t escapes INSIDE those font strings (DBM-Core.lua:8121-8127), which is why they
--     kept appearing beside our own. Hooking OnShow to re-hide is instant, so there is no frame of
--     flicker to trade for it.

-- Every distinct frame DBT parents its bars to. Both anchors are unnamed locals (DBT.lua:179), so a

-- (DBT.lua:249) — and a released bar keeps both its name and its parent, sitting in DBT's reuse pool.
-- So this finds the anchors with nothing LIVE, which the iterator cannot — a login, or any moment
-- between pulls, where every bar has been released back to that pool.

-- ============================ Keeping DBT's books while its bars are hidden ==================
--
-- Hiding the anchors is what makes DBM's bars invisible, and it also FREEZES them. A frame that is
-- not VISIBLE gets no OnUpdate, and every DBT bar's countdown IS its own OnUpdate — DBT.lua:251
-- installs it, and `barPrototype:Update` is where a bar both ticks down and dies:
--
--     self.timer = self.timer - (paused and 0 or elapsed)          -- DBT.lua (Update)
--     if timerValue <= 0 and not (barOptions.KeepBars and self.keep) then return self:Cancel() end
--
-- Nothing else ever expires a bar. There is no CancelAllBars anywhere in DBT, and DBM prunes an
-- expired timer from `startedTimers` on a schedule (DBM-Core.lua:10059-10061), so a mod's
-- combat-end Stop() does not reclaim it either. With the anchors hidden the consequences compound:
--
--     * DBT.numBars is decremented ONLY in Cancel (DBT.lua:969), so it never falls;
--     * DBT:CreateBar hard-returns once numBars >= 15 (DBT.lua:294);
--     * and DBM's Timer:Start bails on that BEFORE it fires anything —
--       `if not bar then return false, "error" end` (DBM-Core.lua:10008-10010), with the
--       fireEvent at :10049.
--
-- So after fifteen expired-but-unreaped timers DBM stops telling us about ANY timer and our own
-- rail goes blank for the session — with DBM's own timers broken alongside it. Suppressing DBM's
-- drawing must not stop DBM working.
--
-- What runs below is the accounting half of DBT's own update and nothing else: the elapsed
-- subtraction and the expiry test, against the same `lastUpdate` clock DBT itself uses, so DBT
-- picks up mid-stride the moment suppression is switched off. Everything skipped — the colour
-- lerp, SetStatusBarColor, SetValue, the timer text, the enlarge animation — is drawing work for a
-- frame nobody can see, which is also why this is CHEAPER than the alternative of parking the
-- anchors off screen and leaving DBT running: five arithmetic operations per bar at REAP_INTERVAL,
-- against DBT's full redraw at frame rate.
--
-- A VISIBLE bar is skipped outright. DBT is driving that one itself, and decrementing it here as
-- well would run it down at double speed.

-- ============================ Bars DBM draws without telling anyone ==========================
--
-- Not every DBT bar comes from a timer object. Several of DBM's own call `DBT:CreateBar` directly
-- and fire no callback at all:
--
--     DBM-Core.lua:1806   the pizza timer — `/dbm timer`, and every custom timer a raid leader
--                         broadcasts that is not a pull or a break (those two do use real timers)
--     DBM-Core.lua:4217   the world-buff alert
--
-- With DBM's bars hidden and no event to hear, those simply vanished — a raid leader's "loot in 5"
-- disappearing is a worse outcome than the double-draw suppression exists to prevent. Taking over
-- DBM's bar display means taking over all of it, so we adopt the orphans: hook CreateBar, and if no
-- callback has claimed that id by the end of the frame, start it on the bus ourselves.
--
-- The deferral is genuinely needed here, and it is the mirror image of the one §C.5j wrongly added.
-- CreateBar returns BEFORE the fireEvent (DBM-Core.lua:10007 then :10049), so at hook time an
-- ordinary boss timer looks exactly like an orphan. One frame later the difference is settled.
--
-- Only while we are actually suppressing: with DBM drawing its own bars, adopting one is the
