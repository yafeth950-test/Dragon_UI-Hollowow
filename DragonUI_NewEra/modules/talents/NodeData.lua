-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/talents/NodeData.lua — authored node-shape layer ("we create the data").
--
-- DOWNPORT: NewEra/Talents/NodeData.lua (Classic 1.15) -> 3.3.5a (WotLK), adapted to the
-- SHARED CONTRACT. Pure logic, no NE.* deps. This file RESOLVES which retail node shape/atlas
-- a talent uses; it does NOT touch any mask API (no CreateMaskTexture/SetMask) — the renderer
-- (Talents.lua) owns mask handling. Resolution stays a pure function.
--
-- Retail renders talent nodes as circle (active ability) / square (passive) /
-- capstone (signature). On Classic, TalentInfoResult had no active-vs-passive field and
-- (per the /ne probe talents dump on 1.15.8) returned spellID = 0, so shape could NOT be
-- derived from the spell at runtime. Hence an authored shape layer.
--
-- WotLK 3.3.5a NOTE: GetTalentInfo natively returns isExceptional (the 7th return value),
-- so the isExceptional-based heuristic ports UNCHANGED — see T.ResolveShape below.
--
-- KEY FINDING from the (Classic) probe — isExceptional is load-bearing:
--   The "exceptional" talents (the ones that historically had the gold/diamond border) are
--   precisely the active-ability talents. Probe sample (Priest): exceptional = {Power
--   Infusion, Inner Focus, Divine Spirit, Holy Nova, Spirit of Redemption, Lightwell,
--   Vampiric Embrace, Mind Flay, Shadowform, Silence} — every one grants/*is* an active
--   ability. hasGoldBorder was unused on Classic (always false). So isExceptional ≈ "active",
--   and we derive the default shape from it, reserving the authored OVERRIDES table for the
--   handful of cases where that heuristic is wrong, and to promote the deepest signature
--   talents to the full capstone (apex) art.
--
-- Resolution order (most specific wins):
--   1. OVERRIDES[talentID]            — authored correction, the source of truth
--   2. capstone        if isExceptional and tier >= CAPSTONE_TIER (active deep talent → round apex)
--   3. capstonesquare  if tier >= CAPSTONE_TIER (passive deep talent → SQUARE art, capstone scale)
--   4. circle          if isExceptional   (active ability)
--   5. square          otherwise          (passive)
--
-- Both deepest-tier (capstone-tier) talents are SCALED UP so they read as prominent
-- finals; only the active one gets the round apex art. Previously a passive deep-tier
-- talent fell through to plain "square" — a normal-size square that looked unfinished
-- next to the enlarged round capstones.

-- Deepest tier — the one whose talents get the enlarged signature art. Vanilla used 7 (the 31-point
-- talent sat at tier 7); WotLK trees are 11 deep. This is the WotLK default: T.SetTierDepth
-- (Talents.lua) overwrites it at login with the depth the character's trees ACTUALLY have, so a
-- server shipping custom/2.4.3-era 9-tier trees still crowns its bottom row.

--   e.g. T.SHAPE_OVERRIDES[<talentID>] = "square"
-- VERIFY (WotLK): overrides sampled from vanilla; revisit per-class once live data is
-- rendered — WotLK class talents/trees differ from vanilla, so seeded entries may be wrong.
