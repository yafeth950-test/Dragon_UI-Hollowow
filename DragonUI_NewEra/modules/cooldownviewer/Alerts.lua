-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/cooldownviewer/Alerts.lua — per-cooldown visual alerts and ready sounds.
--
-- Downport of NewEra/CooldownViewer/Alerts.lua. Each tracked cooldown can carry ONE assigned alert
-- that decorates its icon when the alert's event fires. Retail's event set lives in
-- Enum.CooldownViewerAlertEventType; upstream ports the three with a faithful pre-Legion meaning,
-- and so do we:
--
--   available — the ability came off cooldown. A one-shot flash on the real-cooldown -> ready
--               transition. This is also the trigger for the assigned ready SOUND.
--   refresh   — upstream's hydration of retail's PandemicTime event. Retail fires pandemic at
--               expirationTime - carriedOverToNewCast, gated on that value being > 0; it comes from
--               C_UnitAuras.GetRefreshExtendedDuration and represents retail's duration ROLLOVER on
--               refresh. 3.3.5a has neither the API nor the rollover, so the retail trigger could
--               never fire. Hydrated instead as "the tracked aura is inside the last `window`
--               fraction of its duration" — i.e. refresh it now.
--   usable    — retail's "conditionally castable" notion. Data-driven from AlertData.lua: a target
--               below an execute threshold, or a curated reactive ability becoming castable. Only
--               those spells ever flash; flashing every ready spell is explicitly not the feature.
--
-- A FOURTH, which is ours and not retail's:
--
--   active    — the tracked aura is on the player right now. AURA ROWS ONLY. Retail has no such
--               event because retail's alerts belong to cooldowns; ours are offered on tracked
--               buffs too, and all three ported events ask questions about a COOLDOWN. For a proc
--               with no castable spell of its own name — Surge of Light, a trinket proc, anything
--               the player does not press — the honest answer to every one of them is "never", and
--               the only question worth asking is whether the proc is up. See inActiveState.
--
-- ── THE PANDEMIC BORDER: WHAT PORTS, AND WHAT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Upstream renders `refresh` with a 1:1 port of retail's CooldownPandemicFXTemplate: a static ring
-- PLUS three glow textures that cascade outward, every one of them clipped to the ring shape by a
-- MaskTexture. Those are two separable halves, and only the second half is unportable.
--
-- THE RING PORTS AS-IS (§H.2.10). `UI-CooldownManager-PandemicBorder` is already a hollow
-- rounded-square ring: alpha 0 through the centre, material in two bands at cols 2-8 and 52-58 of
-- 61, real RGB at full alpha. It needs no mask, no crop and no substitute — it is the retail
-- pandemic border, and it lives on sheet 6685874, which Phase 8a already ships. (This header used to
-- say "the art is also absent". That was true before 8a and is not true now.)
--
-- THE CASCADE DOES NOT PORT, for two independent reasons:
--
--   1. MaskTexture does not exist on 3.3.5a. It is not merely missing — !!!ClassicAPI defines
--      CreateMaskTexture and AddMaskTexture as Private.Void ("potentially impossible to implement",
--      WidgetAPI.lua:279/302/476), and Cell's polyfill returns an inert dummy object. The calls
--      would succeed silently and clip nothing. That matters here specifically because
--      PandemicFX-Icon01/02/03 are FILLED 128x128 quads (centre alpha 61/81/24), not rings: without
--      the clip they scale to 1.5x as square smears across the icon and its neighbours. Worse than
--      no FX, and the reason those three atlases are deliberately not registered.
--   2. `Animation:SetTarget` does not exist on this client either (zero occurrences anywhere in the
--      AddOns tree). 3.3.5a animations act on the region that owns the AnimationGroup, so the
--      template's one-group-drives-three-textures structure has no equivalent.
--
-- SUBSTITUTION: the ring itself pulses. One texture on one frame, so the animation acts on the
-- region that owns the group — exactly what this client does support — and no mask is involved at
-- any point. It carries the same signal as the cascade (this aura is expiring, refresh it) using the
-- real art, rather than faking a clip we cannot perform.
--
-- The three LibCustomGlow renderers remain selectable for `refresh` and stay the only option for the
-- other two alert types. The ring is simply a fourth FX, and the default for `refresh`.
--
-- ── ENGINE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `available` is edge-triggered off the item's ConsumeReadyTransition. `refresh` and `usable` need
-- polling: aura time decay, target health and usability transitions do not all raise events on
-- 3.3.5a. One shared 0.2s ticker walks EVERY viewer's items, and does nothing at all unless at least
-- one alert or one ready sound is assigned — the default setup costs a table lookup.
--
-- Every live evaluation is pcall-isolated: a bad read must never raise, least of all in combat.

-- ── FX rendering ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Idempotent by (fx, alert type): re-applying restarts the animation, and at 5Hz that reads as a
-- stutter rather than a glow. `_alertFX` records what is currently up.
-- ── The pandemic ring ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A CHILD FRAME, not a texture on the item. A child frame draws above every layer of its parent, and
-- that is the only way to get above the tile's own art here: the gold frame stack occupies OVERLAY
-- sublevels 0-2 and the cooldown sweep is itself a child frame (§H.2.8). Levelled above the sweep
-- for the same reason the buff glow is — a ring the swipe eats half of is a ring nobody can read.
--
-- OVERSIZED, and the amount comes from the art rather than from taste.
--
-- Retail's own anchor is SetAllPoints, and copying it put the ring INSIDE the icon — the owner's
-- report, and correct. The cell is not a line with glow on both sides. Reading its mid-row alpha:
--
--   cols 0-8    5, 15, 30, 50, 75, 106, 141, 181, 255 — a hard edge at col 8, bleeding OUTWARD
--   cols 9-51   0 — the opening
--   cols 52-60  255 back down to 5 — the mirror
--
-- So the OPENING is what has to land on the icon, and it is 43 of the 61-pixel cell. The remaining
-- 9 per side are glow that belongs outside the icon entirely. Anchored at SetAllPoints those 9 eat
-- into the icon instead, which is exactly what "renders in the icon not around it" looks like.
--
-- 43 is not a coincidence: it is the size of UI-CooldownManager-OORshadow on the same sheet — the
-- icon-sized cell in this art family. The overhang is therefore 9/43 of the icon, in the same shape
-- as ICON_MASK_INSET's 3/64.
local PANDEMIC_BLEED      = 9 / 43
local PANDEMIC_MIN_OVER   = 4      -- a picker tile is small enough to round the bleed away entirely
local PANDEMIC_PULSE_MIN  = 0.45   -- retail cascades; we breathe. See the header.
local PANDEMIC_PULSE_HALF = 0.75   -- seconds per half-cycle, so a 1.5s loop

-- WHAT THE OPENING HAS TO LAND ON IS THE **VISIBLE** ICON, AND THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME RECT.
--
-- A framed viewer tile and a bare picker tile disagree about where the icon ends:
--
--   picker tile   no frame art, so the visible icon IS the .Icon rect.
--   viewer tile   the gold IconOverlay's opening sits M.IconAperture INSIDE the tile — 6.8px on a
--                 50px Essential — and covers the icon's outer edge. The .Icon rect is 46px; the
--                 icon you can SEE is ~36px. Anchoring to .Icon therefore parks the ring's bright
--                 edge ~5px out, in the middle of the gold band, with gold showing between icon and
--                 ring. That is the "sits too far away from the icon edge" report.
--
-- .Icon is wrong for a framed tile in a second way too: it moves with the icon-inset slider, while
-- the frame does not — so the visible edge does not move and a ring tied to .Icon would drift off it.
--
-- Deriving the aperture instead makes both cases one formula, and it lands almost exactly on the
-- tile rect for a framed tile (offsets under a pixel on Essential and Utility alike). That is not a
-- coincidence and it is worth recording: retail anchors this ring with SetAllPoints(item) precisely
-- because 43/61 = 70.5% of the tile is where a frame of these proportions opens. Retail's anchor was
-- right for retail's tile; it was wrong here only for the UNFRAMED picker tile, which is exactly
-- where the first report came from.
--
-- ox/oy come from the IconOverlay's own anchor rather than a recorded copy — that is the source of
-- truth for where the frame sits, and it cannot drift out of sync with it.

-- "Active" = the tracked aura is on the player right now. AURA ROWS ONLY, and it exists because the
-- other three all answer questions about a COOLDOWN: has it finished, is it castable, is the buff it
-- applies running out. None of those is the question a tracked buff asks, which is simply "is this
-- proc up". A Priest assigning an alert to Surge of Light — a 10s proc with no castable spell of its
-- own name — had `usable` (never fires: IsUsableSpell does not know the name), `available` (never
-- fires: no cooldown to finish) and `refresh` (fires for the last 3 seconds of the 10). That is the
-- report this answers.
--
-- The item's own cached flag first: both aura mixins maintain `_auraActive` from the scan that built
-- them, so this costs nothing on the path that matters. The lookup is the fallback for an item that
-- has no such flag, which is any spell tile that somehow carries this type.
--
-- That fallback is no longer a curiosity. `active` is now the honest answer for a DoT — "glow for as
-- long as it is ticking on the target" is precisely what issue #57 asked for — so a SPELL tile
-- carrying this type is an ordinary case, and it goes through the same widened resolver as the rest.

-- transition and no curated usable state". Both halves of that are true, and neither was a reason to

-- define, so checkReadyTransition returns at its first guard and costs one lookup. `usable` reads
-- IsUsableSpell, which answers for a self-buff's own spell exactly as it does for a cooldown.

-- What the omission actually cost was `refresh` — the one alert whose trigger IS an aura decaying,
-- and therefore the most useful of the three on a TRACKED BUFF. It could be assigned from the menu,
-- it lit the badge, it previewed on the settings tile, and then it never fired in play.
