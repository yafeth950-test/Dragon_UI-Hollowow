-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/cooldownviewer/SettingsOptions.lua — the /cdm Settings tab.
--
-- Every Cooldown Manager setting lives here, which is the point: retail's Cooldown Manager settings
-- sit IN the Cooldown Manager, and until now ours sat in DragonUI's options panel — a different
-- window, reached by a different path (PORT_PLAN §G.10).
--
-- WHAT MOVED, AND WHAT DID NOT. The DragonUI options section keeps exactly two things: the master
-- enable toggle (that panel is where a player goes to turn a module OFF, and it is read-only to us —
-- CONTRACTS §0, we register a section, we do not own the window) and a button that opens this one.
-- No stored VALUE is rendered in two windows: two views onto one store stay in sync only as long as
-- both are rebuilt on show, and the first time one is not, the player is looking at a stale value with
-- no way to tell. (Actions are a different matter — see the Reset section below.)
--
-- THE PER-VIEWER SETTINGS ARE NOT HERE ANY MORE. They were, and for a while they were in two places at
-- once: EditorPanel.lua renders them as a dialog beside the frame in edit mode, which is retail's
-- shape and the better one — you are looking at the frame while you change its layout, instead of at a
-- list of numbers in a window that covers it. That duplication was held together by a refresh contract
-- (owner steer: remove it). What remains here is everything the dialog does NOT carry, which is
-- everything that is not per-viewer: buffed-spell glow, icon fit, talent specs, buff tracking, resets.
--
-- What is left in this tab's place is one section of buttons, one per viewer, each of which opens edit
-- mode WITH that viewer selected and its dialog already up. The affordance is the same; the settings
-- are one click further and beside the thing they change.
--
-- Frame POSITION was always the movers' (`/dui edit`) — §B1's decision, unchanged — so the viewers'
-- settings and their position now live in the same place, which is what retail does.
--
-- THE PAGE IS NOT A CATEGORY. It is a second scroll child beside `panel.content`, swapped in by
-- SetDisplayMode (§G.10's option (a)). The alternative — a "category" whose renderer draws controls —
-- would put widget layout behind an adapter whose entire contract is "return a list of spellIDs",
-- and every consumer of that list (ApplyItemFilter, the drag path, RestackCategories) would grow a
-- not-a-grid branch.
--
-- BUILT LAZILY, on the first switch to this tab: ~60 frames that a player who never opens the tab
-- should not pay for.

-- The last unported piece of upstream's panel: its cog menu carried an "Edit Mode" entry that hid the
-- window and toggled retail Edit Mode (Panel.lua:211). §G.4 left it as "drop it or route it at
-- /dui edit" and never decided. Routed, and improved on: because DragonUI's editor can be told which
-- frame to select, the affordance belongs per viewer rather than once globally.
--
-- It now opens the viewer's SETTINGS DIALOG too, not just the editor. Since the per-viewer controls
-- left this tab, this button is the only route from here to them, and dropping the player into edit
-- mode to go hunting for the right handle would be a worse tab than the one it replaced.
--
-- The panel closes only on SUCCESS. Hiding first and then failing (no editor, or in combat) would take
-- the window away and leave the player with nothing to show why.
