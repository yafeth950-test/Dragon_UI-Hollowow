-- DragonUI_NewEra/modules/cooldownviewer/Register.lua — DragonUI wiring for the Cooldown Manager.
--
-- Replaces NewEra/CooldownViewer/EditModeRegister.lua, which is written against `NE.editmode` — a
-- 6,441-line reimplementation of retail Edit Mode this addon does not have and will not port (see
-- PORT_PLAN.md §B1). The two things that file delivered are re-homed:
--
--   position  -> DragonUI's MoversSystem, reached through NE.RegisterPanel (CONTRACTS §4: panel
--                modules never touch DragonUI internals directly)
--   settings  -> the /cdm window's own Settings tab (SettingsOptions.lua). They spent Phases 1-4b in
--                the New Era options tab, for want of anywhere better; §G.10/§G.12 moved them, which
--                is both where retail keeps them and one editor per stored value instead of two.
--                What NE.RegisterOptionSection still registers is the master enable toggle and a
--                button that opens the window.
--
-- Dropped with Edit Mode, deliberately: bottom-managed stacking (EM.RegisterBottomManaged — the
-- viewers would rise above the action-bar tower as bars are added; DragonUI has no equivalent, so
-- the viewers simply stay where the user puts them), and the retail settings-int codec.

-- TIMING: registration runs at PLAYER_LOGIN, not at file load. Every other NewEra module does the
-- same (see modules/guild/Window.lua, modules/auctionhouse/Window.lua) because DragonUI's AceDB
-- profile — which the position round-trip reads and writes — is not guaranteed ready while our
-- files are still executing.
--
-- SEAM: NE.RegisterHUDFrame, not NE.RegisterPanel. RegisterPanel wires a MoversSystem mover, and
-- `/dui edit` does not drive MoversSystem at all — it drives addon.EditableFrames. See the comment
-- block on NE.RegisterHUDFrame in integration/Register.lua for the full detail. Registering a HUD
-- frame with RegisterPanel produces a handle that is silently never shown.

--
-- TWO CONTROLS, deliberately. This section used to carry every viewer setting — the ten per-viewer
-- ones, the two bar-only ones, buff auto-tracking and both resets — because Phase 1 had nowhere else
-- to put them. They now live on the Cooldown Manager's own Settings tab (SettingsOptions.lua), which
-- is where retail keeps them and where a player already is when they care about them.
--
-- What stays is what only makes sense here: the master OFF switch, because DragonUI's options panel is
-- where a player goes to turn a module off, and nobody looks inside a window for the way to make that
-- window's frames stop existing — plus a button to reach the rest.
--
-- No stored VALUE is rendered in both places. A setting with two editors stays consistent only while
-- both are rebuilt on show, and the first time one is not, the player is reading a stale control and
-- cannot tell that from a setting that failed to apply. (EditorPanel.lua later added a third view of
-- the per-viewer settings — retail's on-the-frame dialog — and pays that cost explicitly: it re-reads
-- every control on open and refreshes the Settings tab on every write. See its header.)
