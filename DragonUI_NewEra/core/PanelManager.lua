-- DragonUI_NewEra/core/PanelManager.lua — NE.panelmgr: ONE coordinator for the standalone windows.
--
-- DOWNPORT of NewEra/Core/Chrome/PanelManager.lua (Classic 1.15), heavily trimmed. Every window in
-- this addon is a free-floating DIALOG/HIGH frame that hard-codes its own default anchor at build
-- time, and several of them picked the SAME spot: AuctionHouse / Social / Guild / LFG all default to
-- UIParent LEFT+16 or TOPLEFT 16,-116, Spellbook and Professions both to TOP 0,-55, and the
-- EncounterJournal sits near CENTER. Open two of a pair and they land fully
-- overlapped (github issue #49: the Friends list rendered inside the Auction House). Until now the
-- only de-collision was a hard-coded PAIR — Social pushed Guild to its right and Guild anchored
-- itself to Social's right — which the Auction House was never part of. This replaces that pact.
--
-- WHY NOT BLIZZARD'S UIPanelWindows: writing that table taints it; ShowUIPanel is combat-gated for
-- our protected frames (the Spellbook parents SecureActionButtonTemplate spell cards and opens in
-- combat via a secure toggle); and the stock 3-slot manager CLOSES a panel when the next one won't
-- fit, which would shut the Auction House the moment the player opened their friends list. So we
-- position with plain SetPoint and never touch the secure panel system — same reasoning as the
-- 1.15 source (see its header).
--
-- THE PLACEMENT RULE — two divergences from the 1.15 source, both deliberate:
--
--   (1) HOME WHEN ALONE. The source tiles every panel from the top-left always, because retail's
--       panels have no other home. Ours DO: each module picked its default anchor on purpose (owner
--       steers are recorded in those files), so a window that is the only one on screen goes back to
--       exactly where it has always opened — zero visual change for the overwhelmingly common case
--       of one window at a time. Only when a SECOND managed window is up do they tile the left rail
--       together. This is retail's own "centerOrLeft" semantic, generalised to every window.
--
--   (2) NO CLOSING. The source evicts the oldest panel when the row overflows the screen
--       (PanelManager.lua:555-583). We cascade instead. Auto-closing the Auction House mid-session
--       reads as a bug, not a layout policy, and on a small client the AH (800) + Social (325) row
--       genuinely cannot fit — a staggered stack keeps both title bars, close buttons and drag
--       handles reachable, which a perfect overlap does not.
--
-- USER PLACEMENT WINS. Unlike the source (where panels are not movable at all), every window here
-- drags, and several of them persist through NE.FrameUtil.PersistWindowPosition. A window the
-- player has dragged — this session, or in a previous one via db.windowPos — leaves the system
-- entirely: it is never moved, and it does not take a slot in the row. FrameUtil calls in here on
-- drag-stop and on its resolution reset (which puts every window back in the system, since a saved
-- spot from another resolution is exactly what it drops).
--
-- SCOPE: toggled PANEL windows only. HUD frames (unit frames, action bars, cooldown viewers, the
-- level-up banner) are not panels and register through NE.RegisterHUDFrame instead. The combined bag
-- (bottom-right by design) and the /cdm settings window (a config dialog) are deliberately out.
