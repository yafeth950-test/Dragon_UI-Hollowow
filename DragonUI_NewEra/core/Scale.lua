-- DragonUI_NewEra/core/Scale.lua — per-window scaling for the standalone panels.
--
-- Three modes per window:
--   "ui"     follow the game's UI Scale slider (the frame inherits UIParent → SetScale(1)).
--   "none"   no scaling: pixel-perfect, independent of the UI Scale slider (PinPixelPerfect).
--   "custom" a fixed multiplier in [MIN, MAX].
-- Settings persist account-wide in NE.db.scale[window] = { mode, custom }. The DragonUI options
-- "New Era" tab exposes a dropdown (mode) + slider (custom) per window (see integration/Options.lua),
-- and changes apply IMMEDIATELY to the live frame via S.Apply.

local S = NE.scale

S.MIN, S.MAX = 0.5, 1.5

-- Per-window defaults preserve each window's prior look: spellbook/talents were a fixed 0.8.
-- BUG FIX (owner report 2026-07-17: "the default scaling is massive" after social/guild switched
-- from PinPixelPerfect(f, 1.21) to NE.scale's plain "custom" mode SetScale(c)): those aren't the
-- same computation -- PinPixelPerfect normalizes against physical screen height and the parent's
-- effective scale first, so its 1.21 wasn't a literal 1.21x of anything on-screen, while "custom"
-- mode is a bare f:SetScale(c). 1.21 there rendered much bigger than intended. Owner steer: "make
-- it overall 30% smaller as the addon default, this should show as 1.0" -- 1.0 (plain, unscaled)
-- IS the addon default now; still fully user-adjustable from here same as every other window.
--
-- Windows added 2026-08-09 (auctionhouse / cooldownmanager / encounterjournal / combinedbag): each
-- default reproduces EXACTLY what that window did before it had a setting, so nobody's UI moves on
-- upgrade. The AH and combined bag never scaled themselves at all -> "ui" (a plain SetScale(1.0),
-- i.e. inherit UIParent). The Cooldown Manager window and the Adventure Guide both built themselves
-- with a hard-coded PinPixelPerfect(f, N) -> "none" (which IS PinPixelPerfect) with that same N
-- carried over as their BASE_SCALE below.

  -- Explicit rather than left to S.Get's fallback: LFG already registered itself with SetFrame but

  -- what the fallback was already giving it, so its shipped size is unchanged.

-- BUG FIX (owner report 2026-07-17, round two: "the default is still massive" after DEFAULTS.social/
-- guild's custom value dropped to 1.0). Setting custom=1.0 only made S.Apply's "custom" branch do a
-- literal f:SetScale(1.0) -- genuinely unscaled/native. Turns out social/guild's raw pixel footprint
-- (465x560, unlike the smaller spellbook/talents/professions windows) IS just "massive" at
-- native size on this owner's setup -- 1.0 was never the right target scale, it just happened to be
-- what "not 1.21" meant. Owner steer: "make it overall 30% smaller ... this should show as 1.0" --
-- i.e. the SLIDER should keep reading a clean "1.0" as its default/center point, but the ACTUAL
-- applied scale at that position needs to be 30% smaller than plain SetScale(1.0). A fixed per-window
-- baseline multiplier gets us both: the user-facing custom/mode values stay simple round numbers
-- (slider still shows 1.0, still ranges MIN..MAX same as every other window), while the real
-- on-screen scale is BASE_SCALE[window] * (whatever S.Get's mode/custom computation yields). Windows
-- not listed here default to 1.0 (no change from prior behavior).
--
-- The Cooldown Manager window and the Adventure Guide use BASE_SCALE for a different reason than
-- social/guild do: both were BUILT at a hard-coded oversize pin (the CDM's "owner's +30%" and the
-- Adventure Guide's 1.5), applied as a scale rather than by growing their layouts. Folding those
-- numbers in here keeps their out-of-the-box look identical AND keeps their sliders reading a clean
-- 1.0 at that look, so "1.0" means "how it shipped" on every window in the list.
