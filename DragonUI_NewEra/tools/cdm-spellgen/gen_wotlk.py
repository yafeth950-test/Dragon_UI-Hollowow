# ── Rotation ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The spells a spec presses constantly. None of them has a cooldown, which is precisely why none of
# them was here: resolve.py's castability filter is `cooldown > 1.5s`, so every one of these resolved
# to nothing and was rejected as an unresolvable name. Reported as "lots of classes are missing
# default abilities that dont have cooldowns, such as druids with wrath".
#
# Curated from `listing_nocd.txt` — the client's own list of each class's no-cooldown, non-passive,
# non-talent skill-line abilities (explore_nocd.py) — not from memory. What is IN: the builders,
# spenders, fillers and maintained DoTs/HoTs a spec actually rotates through, plus the ones that read
# as rotation because you watch their timer (Serpent Sting, Slice and Dice, Savage Roar). What is OUT:
# buffs you set and forget (Mark of the Wild, Arcane Intellect, aspects, presences, armors, seals),
# shapeshift forms, pet management, tracking, conjures, rez and out-of-combat healing.
#
# PER CLASS, NOT PER SPEC, because that is the only thing the curated tables can express — the runtime
# gate is "has the player learned it" plus the talent gate, and every druid has learned Wrath. So this
# is the UNION across a class's specs, and the per-spec layouts (F2) are where a player prunes it to
# their own. That is also why the count per class runs to a dozen: a Feral druid seeing Balance's
# nukes in the picker is the cost of a Balance druid finding them there at all.

 # Chain Lightning, Earth Shock and Stormstrike are already in ClassData.lua's vanilla base. Crusader
 # Strike (4s) and Flame Shock (6s) turned out to carry cooldowns too and moved UP into Essential —
 # verify.py refuses a rotation entry that has one, which is the check working in the other direction.

# ── Starter layouts, per spec ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The rotation pass above is a UNION across each class's specs — that is all the curated tables can
# express, since the runtime gate is "have you learned it" and every druid has learned Wrath. It leaves
# a Feral druid looking at Balance's nukes. A starter layout is the answer: the same class list, with
# everything off-spec moved to Not Displayed rather than deleted, so it is all still one drag away.
#
# ESSENTIAL ONLY. Utility is defensives, interrupts and escapes — 8-15 entries a character of any spec
# might press — and pruning it per spec would be churn for no gain. Essential is where the bloat landed
# (27 entries for a druid), and Essential is what this trims.
#
# Keyed by TALENT TAB INDEX, which is what GetTalentTabInfo answers and what the runtime detects. Tab
# order comes from TalentTab.dbc (orderIndex within each class's ClassMask), not from memory:
#
#   WARRIOR  1 Arms          2 Fury          3 Protection

#   DRUID    1 Balance       2 Feral Combat  3 Restoration
#
# Every name is checked against that class's own merged Essential list below; one that is not in it is

-- plus the whole of DEATHKNIGHT, which has no vanilla base at all.
--
-- ROTATION_ADD is not bound by that, and is mostly vanilla spells. It exists because the generator
-- could not previously emit a spell with no cooldown AT ALL — the resolver's castability test is
-- `cooldown > 1.5s`, so Wrath, Frostbolt, Shred and every other filler resolved to nothing and were
-- rejected as unresolvable names. Nothing had ever curated them, in either file.
--
-- FACTS, NOT GUESSES. Every spell ID below was resolved from THIS CLIENT'S OWN DATA, not typed
-- from memory:
--   * Spell.dbc            (DBFilesClient\\\\Spell.dbc, from Data/enUS/patch-enUS-3.MPQ — the
--                           highest-priority readable archive) for name, rank and cooldown
--   * SkillLineAbility.dbc for class attribution, via each skill line's ClassMask
-- The generator authors the curation BY NAME and resolves each name to the rank-1 CASTABLE id —
-- defined as the lowest-rank, lowest-id entry that actually carries a cooldown > 1.5s. That last
-- filter is what separates a real ability from its triggered sub-spells (e.g. Penance resolves to
-- 47540, not its 47666/47750 heal/damage triggers; Death Grip to 49576, not 49560/49575).
--
-- CAVEAT: two archives in this install (patch-4.MPQ, patch-S.mpq) are encrypted and unreadable, so
-- if the server overrides a spell's data there, these ids reflect the stock client rather than the
-- server's edit. Nothing observed suggests it does, but that is the one gap in the sourcing.
--
-- Bucketing follows retail's split: Essential = offensive burst / damage / throughput cooldowns,
-- Utility = defensives, interrupts, CC, escapes and raid cooldowns.
--
-- The BuffIcon / BuffBar viewers are deliberately NOT seeded: they auto-track any player buff
-- <= 120s (see CooldownViewer.lua), which already covers WotLK procs and trinkets, and upstream
-- removed its long-maintenance-buff seed as clutter.

-- lists where that is true, instead of dropping the check for all three.
--
-- Appended into ESSENTIAL_BY_CLASS all the same, which is where retail would show them.
--
-- PER CLASS, not per spec: the runtime gate is "has the player learned it", and every druid has
-- learned Wrath. So this is the union across a class's specs and a Feral druid will find Balance's
-- nukes in the picker — prune per spec in /cdm, which is stored per talent group.

--
-- Tremor Totem's tile is NOT broken, incidentally, and is worth recording: a totem sources its swipe

-- WHAT READS THIS, which for a long time was nothing at all.
--
-- The table used to be introduced as existing so the `available` edge could be reached for a
-- cooldown-less spell. It never was: nothing in the addon referenced M.GCD_ONLY_SPELLS, and
-- ConsumeReadyTransition still gates on IsOnRealCooldown, so `available` on Wrath was as dead after
-- this table shipped as before it. The table was right; the conclusion drawn from it was backwards.
--
-- Reaching the edge would mean firing `available` every time the GLOBAL ends — a flash every 1.5
-- seconds on a filler spell, which is a strobe, not an alert. The honest use of the same fact is the
-- opposite one: a spell with no cooldown cannot offer the two triggers that need one, so the menu
-- stops offering them. See M.SpellHasNoCooldown, consumed by SettingsMenu.lua.

-- drag away in the picker.
--
-- Tab INDEX is the key because that is what GetTalentTabInfo answers. Order is from TalentTab.dbc:

-- cache now that the tables have grown.
