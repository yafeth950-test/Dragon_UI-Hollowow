# WHICH LINES GET A VOTE AT ALL. The plain `most_common(1)` this used to be is wrong, and was
# invisible for as long as the `>1.5s cooldown` filter downstream was throwing the damage away — it
# surfaced the moment the rotation resolver below stopped filtering, as PALADIN reporting 661
# "abilities" against 60-100 for every other class.
#
#   * CATEGORY 7 ONLY. Skill line 202 is ENGINEERING: 321 rows, of which 287 carry no class mask at
#     all, and the 34 that do split 10 PALADIN / 9 SHAMAN / 9 DRUID — class-restricted engineering
#     items. `most_common` broke that near-tie for PALADIN and handed a profession's entire inventory
#     to paladins. First Aid (129) and GENERIC (DND) (183) fail the same way.
#   * MOUNTS EXCLUDED BY NAME. Line 777 is category 7 like the real class lines, and 4 of its 315
#     rows carry a class mask (the paladin class mounts) — so it is unanimously PALADIN and passes
#     every ratio test. It is named rather than thresholded because that is what it is: one line, one
#     reason, no tuned constant that some later patch drifts past.
#   * 90% DOMINANCE. What is left after those two is real class lines, where the winner takes all but
#     a stray row or two.
#
# Verified before adopting: this changes NOT ONE id in the existing Essential/Utility curation. It
# only stops junk lines from offering names. In particular it does NOT use each row's own class mask
# instead of the vote — that was tried, and it loses every talent-granted ability (Penance, Starfall,
# Dispersion, the whole of DEATHKNIGHT), whose skill-line rows carry a class mask of 0.

# ── The rotation resolver ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The filter above is the reason whole classes had no filler in the viewers: a rotational spell —
# Wrath, Shred, Steady Shot, Frostbolt — has NO cooldown, so it resolves to nothing and gen_wotlk.py
# treats that as a hard error. It could never have emitted one.
#
# So this second pass drops the cooldown test and replaces it with the one thing that test was
# standing in for: telling the real ability from its triggered sub-spells. Two rules, both chosen by
# reading candidate dumps rather than by reasoning about them (explore_nocd.py prints them):
#
#   * PREFER AN EXPLICIT "Rank 1", and only fall back to an unranked id when the ability has no
#     ranked row at all. Rejuvenation is the case that forces this: its fifteen ranks are joined by an
#     UNRANKED sixteenth (64801, the glyph's version), and sorting by rank number alone puts that one
#     first, because an unparseable rank string scores 0. Savage Roar and Swipe (Cat) are the other
#     side of it — genuinely single-rank abilities whose rank text is empty.
#   * DROP PASSIVES. A passive is never a button, and without the cooldown filter there is nothing
#     else keeping talent passives out of a list of things to press.
#
# Ranks above 1 are never eligible, so the emitted id stays the rank-1 id the rest of the seed uses
# and the runtime's own rank upgrade (NE.spellbook.HighestKnownRankID) still does the walking.
