"""Generates modules/cooldownviewer/AlertData.lua — the curated Execute / Reactive tables the
visual-alert engine gates its "Usable" event on.

DIFFERENT QUERY from resolve.py, deliberately. That script picks ONE id per ability (the rank-1
castable) because the cooldown viewer tracks one entry per ability. The alert engine instead has to
recognise the ability at WHICHEVER rank the player actually casts, so this resolves EVERY rank.

It also cannot reuse resolve.py's ">1.5s cooldown" castability filter: Execute, Victory Rush and
Riposte have no cooldown at all.

The discriminator is instead SkillLineAbility class attribution, the same join resolve.py uses. Rank
text CANNOT be used for this: 3.3.5a's Spell.dbc gives Overpower rank 1 (7384) an EMPTY rank string
while its ranks 2-4 are labelled, and all four NPC copies of Riposte are likewise unranked — so any
"keep the ranked rows" rule both drops real rank 1s and keeps creature spells. Attribution drops the
impostors cleanly, because NPC spells appear in no player skill line.

Only the ABILITY NAMES and their mechanics are hand-authored; every id is resolved from the client.
