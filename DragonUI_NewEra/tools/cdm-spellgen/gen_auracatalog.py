"""Generates modules/cooldownviewer/CdmAuraCatalog.lua — the per-class pool of trackable SELF-BUFFS.

This is to the buff viewers what gen_arsenal.py is to Essential/Utility: it turns the Tracked
Buffs / Tracked Bars picker from a list of things you have already had into a catalog of things you
can have — retail's shape, where Blizzard ships a curated per-spec aura set through
C_CooldownViewer. There is no such table on 3.3.5a, so it is derived from the client's own DBCs.

WHAT COUNTS AS A TRACKABLE SELF-BUFF

  * some effect is APPLY_AURA (6) with implicit target A = UNIT_CASTER (1) — a buff on YOU, so
    heals, DoTs and raid buffs cast on others are out
  * a real timed duration, 0 < d <= 120s — the same window the runtime auto-tracker uses
    (M.BUFF_TRACK_MAX_DURATION), which is also why food buffs, flasks and permanent toggles are out
  * not passive (Attributes & 0x40)
  * NOT CHANNELLED (AttributesEx & 0x44). Without this, Blizzard, Evocation, Mind Control and
    Tranquility all read as 8-60s "buffs" — a channel's duration lives in the same column as an
    aura's, and there is nothing else in the record to tell them apart.

Reached two ways: the class ability itself, and ONE HOP through EffectTriggerSpell — which is where
the procs live (Clearcasting, Missile Barrage, Lock and Load, Killing Machine, Borrowed Time). The
hop is what makes the catalog worth having; without it you get cooldowns you press and nothing that
happens TO you.

CLASS ATTRIBUTION, AND WHY THE VOTE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH

resolve.py maps skill line -> class by majority vote. That is fine there because its >1.5s cooldown
filter hides the collateral, but here it drags in skill line 183 "GENERIC (DND)" — Grovel, Honorless
Target — which has rows for all ten classes and a per-row class mask of 0. So:

  * a row with a nonzero class mask is authoritative (it names its classes outright)
  * a row with mask 0 falls back to the skill line's class, but only if that line is >=90% one
    class. Marksmanship (85 rows, all HUNTER) qualifies; GENERIC, First Aid, Cloth and the racial
    lines do not

Dropping the racial lines costs Berserking and Blood Fury. They are race-gated rather than
class-gated so they do not fit a per-class catalog, retail's curated list has no racials either, and
the runtime seen-aura registry picks them up the first time you press them.

TALENTS ARE THE "PER SPEC" PART

Talent.dbc gives every talent's spell ranks; TalentTab.dbc gives that talent's class (ClassMask,
col 20) and tree order (OrderIndex, col 22). An aura reachable only through a talent is emitted with
that talent's NAME, and the runtime gate asks GetTalentInfo whether the player actually has it. That
beats a static per-spec list on its own terms: it follows respecs and dual spec.

An aura reachable BOTH from a baseline ability and from a talent is emitted ungated. Showing a row
the player cannot use is a much smaller fault than hiding one they can.

COLUMN POSITIONS, ALL LOCATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED

Every column below is proved by `locate()` against anchors whose values are known independently, and
an ambiguous or failed match is a hard error. Two of them were WRONG on the first attempt in exactly
the way assuming would never have caught: Bloodrage has no duration of its own (its aura is on the
triggered spell 29131) and its first effect is ENERGIZE, not APPLY_AURA — so anchoring on it
"disproved" two correct columns.

KNOWN GAP: Data/patch-4.MPQ and patch-S.mpq are encrypted and unreadable, so if this server
overrides spell data there, these ids reflect the stock client.
